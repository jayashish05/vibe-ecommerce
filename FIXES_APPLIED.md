# Fixes Applied - Checkout Address & Fake Store API Integration

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Checkout Address Validation Error** 
**Issue:** "Please select or add a shipping address" error even after filling in all address details.

**Root Cause:** 
- When a user had no saved addresses, the address form wasn't being shown by default
- The validation logic was checking for `selectedAddress` or `showAddressForm`, but neither was true for new users

**Solution:**
- Modified `fetchAddresses()` to automatically set `showAddressForm = true` when user has no saved addresses
- Updated validation logic to check if user has no addresses, then validate the address form directly
- Added better error handling to show address form if fetching addresses fails

**Files Changed:**
- `/my-app/src/pages/Checkout.js`
  - Line ~28: Added logic to show address form for users with no addresses
  - Line ~68-78: Improved address validation logic

### 2. **Fake Store API Integration**
**Issue:** Products were using static Unsplash images instead of real product data from Fake Store API.

**Solution:**
- Created new backend endpoint `/api/products/seed-fakestore` that fetches products from https://fakestoreapi.com/products
- Modified frontend to automatically seed from Fake Store API on first load
- Removed manual "Load Products" button - now happens automatically

**Backend Changes:**
1. `/backend/package.json` - Added `axios` dependency
2. `/backend/controllers/productController.js`:
   - Added `axios` import
   - Created `seedFromFakeStore()` function that:
     - Fetches 20 products from Fake Store API
     - Maps fields: titleâ†’name, image, price, description, category, rating
     - Inserts into MongoDB
3. `/backend/routes/productRoutes.js`:
   - Added route: `POST /api/products/seed-fakestore`

**Frontend Changes:**
1. `/my-app/src/services/api.js`:
   - Added `seedFromFakeStore()` API function
2. `/my-app/src/pages/Products.js`:
   - Modified `fetchProducts()` to call `seedFromFakeStore()` instead of `seedProducts()` when no products exist
   - Updated description to mention "Fake Store API"
   - Removed manual load button
